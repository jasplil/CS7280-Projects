## Project Overview
Our B+ tree implementation can be used with any type of comparable keys and corresponding value

## Class explanation
1. Index Nodes(internal nodes): These are not a leaf node that contains keys that act as separators to search
all the way to the leaves. These keys don't contain actual data but reference deeper internal nodes
or leaf nodes.
2. internal child keys: these are the keys contained in the child nodes of an internal node, which does not contain tbe actual value
3. Leaf child keys: the bottommost nodes of a b+tree and contain the actual data or pointers to the data. and all these
nodes are linked together as a linked list, when we conduct search function, it looks through the leaf keys to find
the desired data.

here are 4 functions:
1. insertion: insert key-value pairs while maintaining the properties of B+ tree
2. search: retrieve values associated with specific keys
3. display tree: visualize the structure of the tree
4. display node: visualize the subtree structure under that node

to use an instance of the B+ tree:
run `BPlusTree<Integer, String> tree = new BPlusTree<>();`

to insert key-value pairs into the tree:
run `tree.insert(70, "Data3");`

search for a value using a key:
run `String value = tree.search(50);`

display subtree of a key:
run `tree.display(50);`

##  Requirements
JDK 8 or higher

## Run test
use BPlusTreeTest file
